Constant time: an operation that doesn't depend on the number of elements in the dictionary
rooms["exact thing"]
0(1)

Linear time: an operation that does depend on the size of the input
    the time the operation takes increases linerly with the input size
    for loops
        touching everything in the list
        0(n)
        0(constant * n)

Quadratic time: an operation that does depend on the size of the input
the time the operation takes increases quadratically with the input size
going over all possible pairs from 2 lists
    2 for loops
    length of list 1 * length of list 2
    6 * 6 = 36
    0(m * n)
    0(n2)

0(1) < 0(n) < 0(n2)
